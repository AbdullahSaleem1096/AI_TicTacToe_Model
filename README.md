🎮 AI-Powered Tic Tac Toe Game
This is a simple yet intelligent Tic Tac Toe game built using Python's Tkinter GUI toolkit. The game allows a human player (X) to compete against an AI opponent (O) that uses the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to make optimal moves.

🧠 Features
Player vs AI gameplay
AI uses the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for efficient decision-making
Dynamic GUI built with Tkinter
3x3 grid with win detection, draw detection, and move validation
Easy "New Game" button for resetting the board

🛠️ Requirements
Python 3.x
Tkinter (usually comes pre-installed with Python)

🚀 How to Run
Clone or download the repository.

Run the game:
python TicTacToe_3.py
Play!
You go first (X)
The AI (O) will automatically make its move after yours
The game detects wins, losses, and draws

📁 File Structure

TicTacToe.py         # Main Python script containing GUI and AI logic
README.md            # Project documentation (this file)

🧠 How the AI Works
The AI uses the Minimax algorithm, a decision rule for minimizing the possible loss for a worst-case scenario.
It is optimized using alpha-beta pruning to eliminate unnecessary branches in the decision tree.

The AI always tries to win or force a draw.

✨ Highlights
Modular and clean code with comments for clarity

Prevents invalid moves

Can be extended to larger grids with minor modifications

🔄 Resetting the Game
Click the "New Game" button to clear the board and start again.

📌 Future Improvements (Optional Ideas)
Add difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard)
Extend to 4x4 or NxN grid with winning condition logic
Multiplayer support
Score tracking
